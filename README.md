# AVSOFT_Test_Assignment  

## Objective:   
Find the correlation between the number of `bugs` and the features `repository_name`, `commit_hash`, `commit_date`, `commit_author` and `commit_message`.   
Implement a model, based on a given dataset, that is able to predict the number of `bugs` with maximum accuracy.  


## Data description:  
The dataset contains 5 features and 1 target variable.   
- `repository_name` - repository name
- `commit_hash` - commit hash
- `commit_date` - commit date
- `commit_author` - commit author
- `commit_message` - message submitted with the commit
- `bugs` - number of errors (target attribute)
